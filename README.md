# Udacity ExploratoryDataAnalysis Project
This is the third project of my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree: Data Analysis with R.

_In this third course project of the Udacity Nanodegree Data Analyst we were asked to apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies. I decided to choose the wine dataset by Cortez et al. 2009. This dataset consists of more than 5000 red wines. For each wine objective characteristics (e.g.: alcohol, pH, etc.) as well as the quality of the wine (which were evaluated by wine experts) are included._

The html-file **Exploring_Wine_Quality** (together with the corresponding Rmd-file) is the main document of this project.
However, if you are interested in coding, feel free to study the corresponding Rmd-file.

 
Happy Reading!
